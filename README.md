# Crop Viruses Project

## Project Objectives

- With the aid of an entity relationship diagram (ERD), this script serves to load the 'crop virus' table from an excel file, then extract the relevant data and create sub-tables which would then be used as input tables to build a PostgreSQL relational database management system (RDBMS).
